If you are using an alternative debugging interface that\nsupports linter plugins simply disable [Linter][].\n\nIf you do not already have it installed, [language-ruby][] will also be\ninstalled for you.\n\nTo install this packge either search for it from within Atom's settings menu\nor run the following command.\n\n```ShellSession\napm install linter-erb\n```\n\n## Settings\n\nAll of linter-erb's settings are available from within Atom's settings menu.\nIf you prefer to manually edit the configuration file the following settings\nare available:\n\n*   `erbExecutablePath`: Defaults to `erb`, allowing the `$PATH` to resolve the\n    correct location. If you need to override this specify the full path to\n    `erb`.\n\n*   `rubyExecutablePath`: Defaults to `erb`, allowing the `$PATH` to resolve the\n    correct location. If you need to override this specify the full path to\n    `erb`.\n\n*   `trimMode`: Select the trim mode used by ERB when generating the code\n    before sending off to Ruby for checking. Defaults to no trimming. For a\n    full description of what the options mean see [the documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E53394_01/html/E54763/erb-1.html).\n\n    _**Note**_: Modes other than `None` _may_ cause the error line numbers to\n    not match the source line numbers.\n\n### Finding the full path\n\nIf you are unsure of the location on your system of a program there are\nutilities you can use to find the full path. For example to find the path to\n`erb` you would run one of the following:\n\n*   On a UNIX / OS X system simply run `which erb` in a terminal. You should\n    get something similar to `/usr/bin/erb`.\n\n*   On Windows run `where.exe erb` in a prompt. You should get back something\n    similar to `C:\\Ruby22\\bin\\erb`.\n\n[linter]: https://github.com/atom-community/linter \"Linter\"\n[language-ruby]: https://github.com/atom/language-ruby \"language-ruby\"\n[ruby]: http://www.ruby-lang.org/ \"Ruby\"\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","_id":"linter-erb@1.0.2","_shasum":"308b145e06b2119f6efcef307abc1130aaddbe80","_resolved":"file:../d-11621-25669-1tmtkx0/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11621-25669-1tmtkx0/package.tgz"}
