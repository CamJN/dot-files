As\nsuch, the [Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) package will be installed\nautomatically for you if it isn't already installed. This will provide the user interface and run the linter for you._\n\n### Setup\nOnce the package is installed you may need to specify the path to the `php`\nexecutable if Atom is not able to find it automatically. You can do this from\nAtom's settings menu or by editing your `~/.atom/config.cson` file (choose Open Your Config in Atom's menu). If editing the file by hand you should modify/create a\nsection like the following:\n```cson\n'linter-php':\n  # php path. run 'which php' to find the path\n  'executablePath': /usr/bin/php\n```\n\n## Maintainers\n\nThe following people have stepped up to take responsibility for this repository and should be consulted on any releases or major changes.\n\n* [steelbrain](http://github.com/steelbrain) - Release Maintainer\n* [Arcanemagus](http://github.com/Arcanemagus)\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-php/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-php#readme","_id":"linter-php@1.1.6","_shasum":"af4487e70573547c56aa4ac036e4ed19861e3210","_resolved":"file:../d-1151028-32937-j6noht/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1151028-32937-j6noht/package.tgz"}
