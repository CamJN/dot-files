Ensure you have the Atom package [language-rust](https://atom.io/packages/language-rust) installed and active.\n2. Ensure you have [Racer](https://github.com/phildawes/racer) properly installed.\n3. Ensure you have a copy of the [rustc source code](http://www.rust-lang.org/install.html) extracted on your disk.\n4. Install this package via Atom's package manager:\n * go to `Preferences > Packages`, search for `racer`, and install it\n * **OR** use the command line `apm install racer`).\n\n## Configuration\n\ngo to `Preferences > Packages`, search for `racer`, and click `Settings`\n\n| Display Name                             | Description                                                                                                                                                      | Required | Name                          |\n|:-----------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------|:------------------------------|\n| Path to the Racer executable             | Full path (including executable) of Racer's binary (e.g. `/Users/me/racer/bin/racer` or `c:\\racer\\bin\\racer.exe`)                                                | `YES`    | `racer.racerBinPath`          |\n| Path to the Rust source code directory   | Should point to the rustc source directory (e.g. `/Users/me/code/rust/src/`)                                                                                     | `YES`    | `racer.rustSrcPath`           |\n| Autocomplete Scope Blacklist             | Scopes for which no suggestions will be made (e.g. `.source.go .comment`)                                                                                        | `NO`     | `racer.autocompleteBlacklist` |\n| Show position for editor with definition | Can be `Right` or `New`.
