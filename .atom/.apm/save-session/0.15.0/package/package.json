Otherwise, files from your last session\n will be restored.\n - `Restore Open File Contents` - Whether or not file contents will be\n automatically restored on load. This has no effect if `Restore Open Files` is\n disabled.\n - `Restore Open Files` - Whether or not files will be reopened.\n - `Restore Projects` - Whether or not projects will be reopened.\n - `Restore Window` - Whether or not the window size/positions will be saved.\n - `Skip Save Prompt` - This will disable the save on exit prompt.\n - `Extra Delay` - Adds an extra delay for saving files when typing.\n - `Restore Scroll Position` - **Experimental** Saves the scroll position of files.\n\n### Other settings\nThese settings are used by the package to restore data. You can change them, but\nthey will all be set by the package when a related event happens.\n\n - `Height` - The height of the editor\n - `Width` - The width of the editor\n - `X` - The x position of the editor\n - `Y` - The y position of the editor\n\n### Commands\n\nThere is currently only one command: `Save Session: Reopen Project`. This is\nmostly for me, or other developers. All it does is reopen the current project.\nThis allows you to edit a package and reload it without exiting out of your\ncurrent window or loosing the project in the new window.\n\n## How it works\n\nSave Session saves your data in two different ways. The first, is through Atom's\nsettings API. Simple things like window dimensions are saved here, but nothing\ncomplicated. The second is on your file system. Things like files info is stored\nin a folder at `<atom package dir>/save-session/<project path>/projects.json` by\ndefault.\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to submit issues if you see anything misbehaving. The more information\nyou can give me about your issue the better. Things like operating system, Atom\nversion, Save Session version, your Save Session config, other installed\npackages, and any error messages in the console that mention Save Session are\nhelpful.\n\nPull requests are also welcome if you want to improve or change something.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mpeterson2/save-session/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mpeterson2/save-session","_id":"save-session@0.15.0","_shasum":"50ad445e91c2a5707d5cd266869d9a8fabd9ab87","_resolved":"file:../d-115417-23556-1cfcz6w/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115417-23556-1cfcz6w/package.tgz"}
