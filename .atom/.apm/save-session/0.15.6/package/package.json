I liked how\n[Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) does this, so I wanted to recreate\nit for Atom.\n\n![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mpeterson2/save-session/master/preview.gif)\n\n## Settings\n\n - `Data Save Folder` - The root folder to save the session data in.\n - `Restore Open File Contents` - Whether or not file contents will be\n automatically restored on load.\n - `Skip Save Prompt` - This will disable the save on exit prompt.\n - `Extra Delay` - Adds an extra delay for saving files when typing.\n\n## How it works\n\nFile info is stored in a folder at\n`<atom package dir>/save-session/<project path>/projects.json` by default and\ngets reloaded at when you reopen the same project again.\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to submit issues if you see anything misbehaving. The more information\nyou can give me about your issue the better. Things like operating system, Atom\nversion, Save Session version, your Save Session config, other installed\npackages, and any error messages in the console that mention Save Session are\nhelpful.\n\nPull requests are also welcome if you want to improve or change something.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/mpeterson2/save-session/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/mpeterson2/save-session","_id":"save-session@0.15.6","_shasum":"ae8202e398c078e6b4b3923f7199ee430d507ae1","_resolved":"file:../d-115529-4578-1hw84u2/package.tgz","_from":"../d-115529-4578-1hw84u2/package.tgz"}
