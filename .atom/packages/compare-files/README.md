# compare-files

Compares two files and shows the diff

## UPDATE (06/30/2015)
From Targeter21 - I fixed all the errors and deprecation warnings with the plugin and all should be good now.

## UPDATE (05/28/2015)
As I do not use atom as my primary editor anymore and the fact that I do not have enough time to devote to this, I have unpublished the package from atom packages and will not be maintaining this package anymore.

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `apm install compare-files`

## Usage

1. Click on the two files that are to be compared in the tree view
2. Invoke the command using any of the below:
  1. From Command Palette (<kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>⌂</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>) invoke `Compare Files: Compare`
  2. Right click on one of the selected files and choose `Compare Files`
  3. Use the keyboard shortcut - <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> (Windows and Linux: <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd>)
