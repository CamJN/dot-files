# Atom git-control

## What

Provides a GUI interface to manage all commonly-used git commands.

This is a first-release, while tested as part of creating this package, it has not been extensively used on much larger projects. In short: there are possibly still some issues remaining. At the same time, wanted to get the package out there and used.

## How

- Checkout or switch to any available branch with a click on the local/remote branch
- Select files to commit, either all or with an individual selection
- Compare the current working tree changes to the selected local branch
- Merge any other branch into the current active branch
- Create branches, either by remote selection of local branching
- Reset any file to its previous state with a checkout
- All git commands are logged, the commands used and output is visible
- Command available are activated based on working tree status
- Automatically fetches remote status on activation
