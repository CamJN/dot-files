  "readme": "# Rust language support in Atom\n\nAdds syntax highlighting and snippets to [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) files in [Atom](http://atom.io/).\n\n## Install\n\nInstall the package `language-rust` in Atom (Preferences->Packages) or Atom's package manager from a shell:\n\n```bash\n$ apm install language-rust\n```\n\n## Bugs\n\nGrammar rules were written from scratch. They seem to work for most cases. However there are most certainly still a few cases that result in wrong syntax highlighting. Feel free to fix it and send a pull request, or open an issue to report it.\n\n## Links\n\n* [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/) -- a safe, concurrent, practical language\n* [Atom](http://atom.io/) -- a hackable text editor for the 21st Century\n",
